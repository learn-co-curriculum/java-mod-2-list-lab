# List Lab

## Learning Goals

- Create and work with Lists

## Instructions

Create a `Library` class that holds a `List` of `Book` objects. This may look
similar to some example code we have used in the past, except before we always
had the `Library` class hold an array of books. A `List` will be a better data
structure for us to use since it is dynamic, and we can continuously add more
books.

Follow the given instructions and tips:

- Create a `Book` class.
  - The `Book` class will need the following properties:
    - Title
    - Author
    - Genre
    - Number of pages
  - The `Book` class will also need accessor and mutator methods for accessing
    the above properties.
- Create a `Library` class.
  - The `Library` class will need the following properties:
    - List of `Book` objects
  - The `Library` class will need to be able to add a `Book` to its library.
  - The `Library` class will need to be able to display the `Book` objects in
    its library.
  - The `Library` class will need to be able to check if a `Book` object exists
    in its library based off the title.
- Use the `LibraryDriver` class to run your code and use as a reference to how
  your code will be tested.

## Starter Code

Consider the driver class when writing the code for the `Book` and `Library`
classes:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class LibraryDriver {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Library library = new Library();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int choice = -1;
        do {
            printMenu();
            choice = scanner.nextInt();

            switch (choice) {
                case 0:
                    break;
                case 1:
                    Book book = promptAddBook();
                    if (library.addBook(book)) {
                        System.out.println(book.getTitle() + " has been added to the library!");
                    } else {
                        System.out.println(book.getTitle() + " could not be added to the library.");
                    }
                    break;
                case 2:
                    library.displayBooks();
                    break;
                case 3:
                    String title = promptTitle();
                    if (library.findBook(title)) {
                        System.out.println("We found the book titled " + title);
                    } else {
                        System.out.println("We could not find the book titled " + title);
                    }
                    break;
                default:
                    System.err.println("An error has occurred!");
            }
            System.out.println();
        } while (choice != 0);
    }

    public static void printMenu() {
        System.out.println("0. Exit");
        System.out.println("1. Add book to library");
        System.out.println("2. Show books in library");
        System.out.println("3. Get book from library");
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static Book promptAddBook() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("What is the title of the book?");
        String title = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println("What is the author of the book?");
        String author = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println("What is the genre of the book?");
        String genre = scanner.nextLine();
        System.out.println("How many pages is the book?");
        int pages = scanner.nextInt();
        return new Book(title, author, genre, pages);
    }

    public static String promptTitle() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("What is the title of the book you are looking for?");
        return scanner.nextLine();
    }
}
```
